# Purpose
The data is about spending habits across generations (Millenials, Generation X, Baby Boomers and Traditionalists). The data also breaks down these spending habits by category for types of purchases. Through data visualization we explore the different spending habits across generations.

* Millenials spend more on elec/hobbies/clothing than any other generation
* Traditionalist spend the least on elec/hobbies/clothing and gasoline
* Millenials spend the least on furniture/building
* Millenials spend more on gasoline than any other generation
